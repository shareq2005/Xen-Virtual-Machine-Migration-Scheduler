This is a python utility I developed for my capstone design project. The tool is used to live-migrate virtual machines which are running on the Xen Framework, from one cluster (physical machines) to another.

It implements a 'smart' algorithm my team worked on, and live migrates the virtual machines optimally within a fixed TTL.
