This is a python utility I developed for my capstone design project. The tool is used to live-migrate virtual machines which are running on the Xen Framework, from one cluster (physical machines) to another.

It is used to live migrate virtual machines optimally within a fixed TTL. This is done through scheduling the migrations based on the RAM size of each VM.
